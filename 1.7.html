<!-- Inline:
Inline elements are those elements which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of element.
eg:
<span>This is a paragraph</span> <span>This is also a paragraph</span> 
-->
 <!-- Block-Element :  
     block-level elements take up the entire space of its parent element. Let us understand this with an example-

If we write any text in the paragraph tag like this-
<p>This is a paragraph</p>

<p>This is also a paragraph</p>
