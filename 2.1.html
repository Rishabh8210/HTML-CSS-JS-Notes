    There are three ways to Add CSS-

Inline CSS- CSS is added to the elements directly using the style attributes.
Internal CSS- CSS is kept inside the head tags in <style> tags
External CSS- CSS is kept separately inside a .CSS style sheet. It involves two steps-

First, write the CSS in.CSS file.
Include that CSS file to Markup.
